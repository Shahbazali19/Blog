                            <strong>Ramzan 2021:</strong>
                            <p>The holy month of Ramzan brings with it a fresh wave of festive cheer. Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar during which the 'Quran' was first revealed.  Muslims around the world observe fasts to celebrate this month long festival. </p>
                            <p>Ramzan is a time of self-reflection to focus on the soul rather than the body and an opportunity to reconnect with your faith. Fasting, during this period, is seen as a way of instilling self-control. The day starts at the crack of dawn with a meal called 'Suhoor' or ‘Sehri' meal and rounds off by breaking the fast after sunset, followed by an elaborate 'Iftar' meal. During the day, people abstain from consuming food or water.Mansoor Ali from Bengaluru by Foot organizes food walks and has been keeping this fast since 20 years. He explains, “While keeping the roza during Ramadan, you are setting an example for a lifestyle that you should be following throughout the year. For the first few days, you do feel a bit lethargic but later a sense of calmness and ease takes over.”!</p>

                            <strong>'Fasting'</strong>
                            <p>One of the benefits of fasting is that it is an opportunity for you to renew your identity with the Ummah. Contrary to what many people think, Ramadan is not an individual experience but is about the community. The best thing about fasting is that the Muslims fast together, allowing us to identify with one another in our obedience to Allah (SWT). This strengthens us as Muslims.

                                As we welcome Ramadan, let’s keep the entire Muslim Ummah in our thoughts. There are many individuals in some parts of the world who will be fasting under the open skies with little personal belongings; like the people of Syria, for example who rely on Aid for Syria. So, be sure to donate generously to their cause as you make your fast.</p>

                            <strong>'Sehri' or 'Suhoor'</strong>
                            <p>'Sehri' or 'Suhoor' is the pre-dawn meal eaten before the Fajr prayer (the first of the five daily prayers) and is taken as a blessing.  Even if breakfast is served before the sun wakes up, it remains the most important meal of the day and shouldn't be skipped.</p>
                       <p>This is usually accompanied with tea or a glass of milk and finished with a bowl of Kheer or Seviyan. A single verse prayer – ‘Roze ki Neeyat' – is offered after eating to begin our fast,”</p>

                            <strong>'Iftar'</strong>
                            <p>Performing Iftar is an act that brings blessings for Muslims. Some people make arrangements for Iftar for others such as in a mosque. This is a great act of kindness and one that is greatly favoured by Allah (SWT). It is said that Allah (SWT) will open the gates of forgiveness for those who help fast observers in acquiring adequate Iftar to break their fast at this time. The one who gives a fast observer water to drink at the time of Iftar will be given a drink from Allah’s fountain where they will never again feel thirsty.

                                Ramadan teaches us a great number of things; patience, piety and discipline are just a few to name. Muslims should strive to take advantage of the opportunity Ramadan brings. This Ramadan, Muslims all around the world will be fasting, performing Aitekaaf and Taravihs and giving Zakat. Everyone will be keen on obtaining the blessings of the night of Lailat-ul-Qadr, the Night of Power.!</p>
